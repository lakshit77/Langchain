# Meeting Notes - Q4 Planning Session

Date: September 28, 2024
Location: Conference Room B
Attendees: James, Sarah, Michael, Elena, Myself

## Action Items
- Complete Q4 budget projection by 10/5 (Assigned to: Sarah)
- Finalize holiday marketing campaign concepts by 10/12 (Assigned to: Elena)
- Schedule vendor reviews for technology upgrade project (Assigned to: Michael)
- Prepare sales team training materials for new product launch (Assigned to: James)
- Update project management software with new timeline (Assigned to: Myself)

## Key Discussion Points

### Budget Planning
We reviewed Q3 performance, which came in 4% under budget primarily due to delayed hiring in the engineering department. Sarah presented initial Q4 projections showing we're on track to meet annual targets if we proceed with the scheduled product launch in November.

### Marketing Campaign
Elena presented three concepts for the holiday marketing campaign:
1. "Home for the Holidays" - Focusing on family-oriented use cases
2. "New Year, New Possibilities" - Emphasizing productivity benefits
3. "Gift of Time" - Highlighting time-saving features

Team consensus leaned toward option 2, but Elena will develop all three further before final decision next week.

### Technology Upgrade
Michael reported that the server infrastructure upgrade will require a 36-hour maintenance window. We discussed potential dates and agreed on the weekend of November 9-10, as this falls before the holiday shopping season but after the product launch.

### Product Launch Timeline
- Development freeze: October 15
- QA testing complete: October 25
- Marketing materials finalized: October 30
- Sales training: November 1-5
- Public announcement: November 8
- General availability: November 12

## Personal Notes
- Need to circle back with James about staffing concerns in the sales department
- Research the competitor product Elena mentioned - particularly their pricing strategy
- Schedule one-on-one with Michael to discuss my team's involvement in the infrastructure upgrade
- Consider moving my vacation week to early December instead of November to avoid product launch conflicts
